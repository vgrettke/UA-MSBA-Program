# final_capstone_project

This is the repository for a project that lasted the final semester of my Master's of Business Analytics Program at the University of Alabama 2022.


**Overview**

Students will work in teams to devise data-driven strategies for a grocer that targets improving customer experience, increasing complementary purchases, or both. Students teams will use a dataset previously open-sourced by Instacart as the primary data source for all analyses. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data) Faculty will provide an overview of the dataset in one or more of the seminar class sessions. 

As mentioned previously, the goal of the project is for teams to devise data-driven strategies that target improving customer experience, increasing complementary purchases, or both. These objectives are purposefully broad, and student teams may approach the problem from a variety of vantage points. 

As an example, student teams may pursue the design of models for a recommendation system that suggests purchases to customer based on past buying history, common complementary items, customer demographic, other novel metrics of product or customer similarity, or a combination of the mentioned features

**Goal**

Develop a method for generating product recommendations for customers based on previous purchase history and shopping cart status.
