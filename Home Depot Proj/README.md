Vehicle Routing Project Guidelines

Description: The purpose of this team project is to design, construct, and use a Python application that is capable of solving a capacitated vehicle routing problem with multiple demand points and suggesting a distribution strategy for a subset of U.S. states. For the purpose of this project, a distribution strategy specifies:

how many distribution centers (DCs) to open,
where to open them,
the customer assigned to each DC,
and data insights to support your recommendation.
The data you will be using is based on Home Depot locations in the states of California (CA), Texas (TX), and Alabama (AL). You will be determining solutions for each state. Problem assumptions are:

Home Depot distributes goods to "customer" stores using a single DC and makes weekly shipments.
Home Depot considers each state separately, i.e., DCs in AL ship only to stores in AL,
Demand is given in pounds. Essentially, we are assuming that the products are "heavy", thus, when shipping, we are more constrained by weight rather than volume.
You have access to vehicles that can haul 40,000 in each trip.
Presentations: Each team will give a 20 minute presentation detailing their approach to the problem, along with their results for each state and any justification.
